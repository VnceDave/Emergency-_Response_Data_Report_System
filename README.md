## ⊹˚₊‧ Overview

ERDS is a console-based Java application designed to record, search, edit, and manage emergency incident reports directly through the terminal.

It demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as **encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism**, and structured **file handling** using Java serialization.  
All reports are stored in a `.dat` binary file.

Users can:

- ✏️ Add a new report  
- 📋 View reports (brief or full details)  
- ✍🏻 Edit existing report  
- ❌ Delete a report  
- 🔍 Search by ID, event, or location  
- 🔐 Login as *Authorized Personnel* for restricted actions  
- 💾 Auto-save all changes
